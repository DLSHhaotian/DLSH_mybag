PiksiRTKSync 1.0 uses TCP sockets with a specific port to communicate from one client to another.
This requires that one of the two participants opens a server port on a static IP address and that no firewall blocks the port.


PiksiRTKSync 2.0 uses a WebSocket server to communicate between clients.
This requires an externally hosted always-on server running Node.js.
The latency is bigger, but this is no concern for RTK sync.
Once the server is set up, the Android app is significantly easier to use (input the server address, and then plug-and-play).
